    "#### What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are python program files saved with the .py extension desgined to solve certain problemsand allow reusability of code. Modules in Python provides us the flexibility to organize the code in a logical way. Modules allows us to break a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains.This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",
    "- **Reusability**:Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Built-in Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sys**: This module provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment.\n",
    "- **time**: This module has many time related functions.\n",
    "- **math**: This module presents commonly required mathematical functions.\n",
    "- **os**: This module has functions to perform many tasks of operating system.\n",
    "- **random**: Python’s standard library contains random module which defines various functions for handling randomization. "

    "\n",
    "#### What is a package?\n",
    "\n",
    "A package is a collection of various modules designed to perform similiar tasks. Physcially, it consists of Python modules containing an additional `__init__.py` file. , which distinguishes a package from a directory that is supposed to contain multiple Python scripts. Packages can be nested to multiple depths if each corresponding directory contains its own `__init__.py` file. `__init__.py` helps the Python interpreter to recognise the folder as package. It also specifies the resources to be imported from the modules. If the `__init__.py` is empty this means that all the functions of the modules will be imported. All the packages are modules but not all modules are packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has same advantages as that of a module, but in a broader perspective. \n",

    "#### Examples of Packages\n",

    "- **pytest**: It provides a variety of modules to test new code, including small unit tests or complex functional tests.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: It is a Python package for fast and efficient processing of tabular data, time series, matrix data, etc.\n",

Because the Numpy array is densely packed in memory due to its homogeneous type, it also frees the memory faster.\n",
